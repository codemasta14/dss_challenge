#Challenge_06.1 'Everlasting Love'

# Your name is Julie, and you're a brand new freshman at BYU-Idaho
# In the last three weeks you've given your number to 32 different boys, but only kissed 8 of them.
# But no more of that because you have a boyfriend. His name is Cody and he's the most wonderful man in the world.
# You've already had the marriage talk, and you're both positive that you're the most perfect match ever.
# Lately though, you've been noticing how cute Kody's roommate, Dylan is. You've written your (soon to be) ex boyfriend pages and pages
# Of love letters already and it would be a downright shame to let all that effort go to waste on someone that
# Isn't as cute as Dylan. 

# Challenge: Replace all mentions of Cody in the love letter with Dylan. Don't mess up or else you could be in 
# A terribly awkward situation!

#Bonus: That's not my name
